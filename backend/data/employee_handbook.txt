CHAPTER 1: WELCOME TO ACME

Welcome to Acme Corporation! We're thrilled to have you join our team of innovators, dreamers, and doers. Since our founding in 1985, Acme has been at the forefront of widget manufacturing and distribution. Our mission is simple: to create the highest quality widgets while fostering a workplace where every employee can thrive.

CHAPTER 2: WORKING HOURS AND TIME OFF

Standard working hours at Acme are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. However, we understand that life happens, and we offer flexible scheduling options for eligible employees. Please discuss any scheduling needs with your direct supervisor.

Paid Time Off (PTO): Full-time employees accrue PTO at a rate of 1.5 days per month, totaling 18 days per year. After 5 years of service, this increases to 2 days per month (24 days per year). PTO requests should be submitted through the HR portal at least two weeks in advance for planned absences.

Sick Leave: Employees receive 10 sick days per year. These do not roll over and are separate from PTO. If you're feeling unwell, please notify your supervisor before your shift begins.

Holidays: Acme observes 10 paid holidays per year, including New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving (2 days), Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and two floating holidays of your choice.

CHAPTER 3: BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION

Health Insurance: Acme offers comprehensive health insurance through BlueCross BlueShield. Coverage begins on the first of the month following your start date. We offer three plan tiers: Basic (employee pays 10% of premium), Standard (employee pays 20%), and Premium (employee pays 30%). All plans include dental and vision coverage.

401(k) Retirement Plan: Employees are eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan immediately upon hire. Acme matches 100% of contributions up to 4% of your salary and 50% of the next 2%, for a maximum company match of 5%.

Life Insurance: Basic life insurance equal to one year's salary is provided at no cost. Additional coverage may be purchased through payroll deduction.

CHAPTER 4: WORKPLACE POLICIES

Dress Code: Acme maintains a business casual dress code. Jeans are acceptable Monday through Thursday if they are clean and without rips or tears. Fridays are casual days where t-shirts and sneakers are permitted. Client-facing employees should dress in business professional attire when meeting with external stakeholders.

Remote Work: Eligible employees may work remotely up to 2 days per week with supervisor approval. A Remote Work Agreement must be signed and filed with HR. All remote workers must maintain a dedicated workspace and be available during core hours (10 AM - 3 PM).
